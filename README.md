This is a spell checker that I wrote in C. It will take input files from the command line and parse them to check to see if a particular word is formatted and spelled correctly. The inputs include a user dictionary to load a list of words, an input file for which words it should check, and a target output file. For any word that is spelled incorrectly, the checker will append the string " [sic]" to indicate so. The program can handle input files and dictionaries of abitrary size by dynamically allocating memory pass a certain thersold size, resizing its data strcture every time it needs to.
